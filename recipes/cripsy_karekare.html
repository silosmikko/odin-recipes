    <p>Skip this step if you are using annato oil and go to the next step.</p></li>
    <li><p>Add some oil (or annato/aschuete oil) into a pot and saute your onions until it turns translucent. Add garlic, cook for a minute and then add some water into the pot. Bring it to boil on high heat, once boiled turn it down to medium heat, add your annato powder & water mixture and add peanut butter.</p>

    <li><p>Steam your green beans, mushrooms and pak choi until cooked and set aside for later.</p></li>
    <li><p>Taste your peanut sauce, add more salt if required but don’t forget that you will have some salted shrimp paste to complement the finish dish later. Turn the heat off your peanut sauce.</p></li>
    <li><p>In a large pot or if you have a deep fryer, add some oil and heat it before frying the pork. When frying be careful as it may spit! Cook the pork until crispy and golden. Set side until all the pork is deep fried.</p></li>
