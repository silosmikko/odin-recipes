    <h1>Crispy Pork Kare-Kare Recipe</h1>
    <p>Arguably the most famous hodge podge of colorful vegetables and meaty goodness, Kare-kare has long made a name for itself in Filipino cuisine. </p>
    <p>And while attempts to recreate this succulent, rich mix of string beans, eggplant and ox tail may take quite some effort, we continue to patronize this beloved dish. And why wouldn’t we?

    <p>Skip this step if you are using annato oil and go to the next step.</p></li>
    <li><p>Add some oil (or annato/aschuete oil) into a pot and saute your onions until it turns translucent. Add garlic, cook for a minute and then add some water into the pot. Bring it to boil on high heat, once boiled turn it down to medium heat, add your annato powder & water mixture and add peanut butter.</p>
