Good day!
Today is my 2nd day of The Odin Project :)
I started TOP this 17th of April 2023 and today is the 19th.
This is my first actual project ever as an aspiring software engineer!
Join me in my journey as I become a software engineer.
This may not be much as of this moment but I assure you one day I will be one of the greatest software engineer.
I am self taught and only studying using TOP but as soon as I finish the foundation I will also attend other courses while taking the Java path of TOP.
I am a graduate of BS Aeronautical Engineering and decided to change career because this is where I find myself happy and at peace and this is what I want to do as I grow up.
Please bare with my first project as it may not look that pleasing because I am still learning.
I also want to see this once I finish TOP and see the progress I made over the time.
If you are seeing this after I finished TOP and made better projects in the future I want this to be an insipiration to others that everyone could make it as long as you want it. See that I started from here and because you love something that you do you'll be great with it.
